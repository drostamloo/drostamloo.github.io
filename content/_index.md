This is the homepage of Daniel Rostamloo. As of September 2023, I am a first-year graduate student in mathematics at the [University of Washington](https://math.washington.edu). I was previously an undergraduate student in mathematics at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu). My interests are in arithmetic algebraic geometry and moduli theory. My CV can be accessed [here](/CV.pdf). 

The best way to reach me is by emailing rostam[at]uw[dot]edu.
