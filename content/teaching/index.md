## Teaching

I will be a graduate student instructor beginning in Fall 2023. Content for the sections that I teach will be made available on this page.

Other teaching responsibilities I have held are as a lecturer, contest writer, and grader at the [Berkeley Math Circle](https://mathcircle.berkeley.edu) and as a contest organizer, writer, and grader for the [Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.bamo.org).
